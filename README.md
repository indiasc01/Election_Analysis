Election Analysis

Overview and Purpose
In this module, we were asked to help Seth and Tom audit election results. We were given data from different counties including candidate names and we needed to find out the election results with the given data. In order to get the results, I had to run a code through Visual Studio Code that was able to analyze the data.

Election-Audit Results
-Total number of votes in the congressional election was 369,711.
-Out of the total votes in the election, the majority of votes came from Denver county with 306,055 votes casted from there. That is a about a 83% rate of voting that came from the county. The next county that came behind Denver was Jefferson county. That county had a rate of 10% voting which casted 38,855 votes. The final county that had the lowest votes was Arapahoe county with a rate of almost 7% and casted 24,801 votes. 
-From the results of the election, we can determine that the county that had the largest number of votes was Denver county.
-Looking at the candidates results, Charles Casper Stockham had a rate of 23% votes, which casted 85,213 votes towards that candidate. The next candidate Diana DeGette had almost 74% votes casted to her, which resulted in 272,892 votes. The last candidate was Raymon Anthony Doane and he had the lowest votes casted with a 3% rate and 11,606 votes.
-From the results of the candidates, we can determine that the winner of the election was Diana DeGette. Her total percentage of votes was 73.8% which was the highest out of all the candidates and had a total of 272,892 votes casted towards her, resulting in her winning the election.

Election-Audit Summary
From this election analysis we were able to determine what county had the highest amount of votes and  determining what candidate won the election. If we wanted to analyze another election, we can use the same script, but change the variables. If we wanted to analyze state election, we would change county name to state name, which would be the key in the dictionary, and the state votes would be the value. Another election we could analyze using this script could be for a school board director. We would change the county information to district information and the candidate information could stay the same, but still adjust it to the new value information. Overall, no matter what the election type we would look at, we can still analyze it using this election script.

Winner: Diana DeGette
Winning Vote Count: 272,892
Winning Percentage: 73.8%
